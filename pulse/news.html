So this 30 Hour Famine is coming up fast and you guys are already giving us great ideas! There has been talk of sleeping outside in cardboard boxes (I was thinking behind the church by the green truck because its rustikish* back there) so if you have any large (or small) cardboard boxes, or things we can fasion makeshift housing out of go ahead and start bringing it up to the church! If you have any more ideas let me or Justin know, and if you still need more information just click the picture of that sad looking kid on the left. <p>
Be sure to sign up by <b>This Wednesday</b> if you want to participate.<p><p>
<b>Also</b>, we will be doing "Prayer Stations" this Wednesday. It's going to be a little different than normal youth group. We are going to be walking through the stations of the Cross and doing different little activities and such. It's going to be pretty cool, I wish I could be there :(<p>
anyways thats all for this week, stay tuned for more late breaking news from Pulse Ministries!<p>






<em>* Rustikish is a word I just made up. Rustic + Ish = Rustikish</em>

Hey youth. Its been 2 weeks since the last update (sorry about last week it was a little crazy).<p>
Franci had the baby 2 weeks ago! Her name is Holly Reagan Hardisty and she is adorable! The doctors said that they need to take it easy and just chill for a little while longer before we can all go bombard them with love and attention. I will definatly let you all know when that will be. If you want to see pictures you can check my facebook, or go here for all the pictures: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/hollyhardisty" target="_blank">tinyurl.com/hollyhardisty</a><p>
Thanks to Diane for teaching us about prayer, and the Armor of God on Wednesday, and thanks to all of you who payed attention and were respectful to her... those of you who weren't, I know who you are. <p>
As for site updates... there are none. No new pictures. No new videos. Nothing. Hopefully that will change in the near future.<p>
 k, bye.

Hello all you Pulseities,<p>
As some of you already know, I uploaded <a href="pictures.html" target="main">pictures</a> from Whirlyball on Sunday and also threw together a quick <a href="videos.html" target="main">video</a> shot with Franci's little Flip video camera thing.<p>
Feel free to grab any of those pictures and use 'em on Facebook, or Myspace or whatever else has surfaced within the past twelve hours. All you have to do is right click the picture and click 'open in new window'. If you get confused ask Zach, Because he's already done it. (Thanks again for the props Zach)<p><p><br>
Remember to sign up for Ronald McDonald House on March 1st.<p>
Also, Justin said on March 11, the youth will eat... I don't know what that means so you'll have to pay attention on Wednesday.<p>

Hey Everybody<p>
Ministry Team applications are on the site now, conveniently located in the <a href="forms.html" target="main">Forms</a> tab.  Note the due date of November 19th.  I didn’t include any guidelines with the apps; I’m going to spend some time in prayer,and we’ll talk more when we turn everything in.  Hope y’all don’t miss me too much while I’m gone, and have fun filling everything out.  I’m looking forward to reading what God has put on each of your hearts!  Love you all!

Hello! Only one update today, I changed the <a href="videos.html" target="main">video</a> page quite a bit. Instead of using Youtube I'm trying this new site called <a href="http://vimeo.com" target="blank">Vimeo</a>. Their videos are much higher quality and they support widescreen (which is what all the videos are) so check it out, lemme know what you think. The problem is, I have to upload all those videos onto this site, but it'll be worth it. I'm still working on it but right now I wanna go to sleep.

Ok, I changed the <a href="calendar.html" target="main">Calendar</a> page a little bit. We <em>had</em> two different caledndars. One for regular events, and one for special events (trips, fundraisers, ect...) But I decided to have just the special events calendar, since most everybody knows when we meet. It just makes for a better looking, less cluttered page.<p>
Also, I added pictures from Bridgeport Camp on the <a href="pictures.html" target="main">Pictures</a> page, so be sure to give those a look. (especially the batman broken window).<p>

Welcome to the new youth website! I realized that the other one was a waste of space and money, so I condensed it down to this little popup website thing. Everythings still here! Pictures, Videos, Forms, and a new Calendar! There's still work to be done, like getting some background music up and posting current pictures.<p> Check back often, I'll be updating it alot more than the other website, because I know what I'm doing with this one. It's built from scratch so I can do whatever I want with it! If you have any suggestions or whatever, just email me at <a href="mailto:eric.huecker@gmail.com">eric.huecker@gmail.com</a>.<p>
